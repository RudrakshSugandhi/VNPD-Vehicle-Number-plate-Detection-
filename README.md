One of the university's most common intelligent video analytics applications is automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) on stationary to fast-moving vehicles. Implementing ALPR in real-time is critical to fully serving the market demands. 
Traditional techniques rely on expensive and difficult-to-maintain specialized cameras and processing hardware. The ALPR pipeline begins with detecting vehicles in the frame using an object detection deep learning model, followed by localizing the license plate using a license plate detection model and finally recognizing the characters on the license plate. Deep neural network-based optical character recognition (OCR) is a popular technique to recognize characters in any language. 
We will be using a state-of-the-art Deep NN model that will make the License Plate detection faster in real-time and provide better prediction accuracy. Apart from that, we plan to introduce a decentralized data training framework like Federated Learning which will reduce the huge amount of processing load on one single server and get it distributed over multiple processing units. To sum up, the entire project is to design a faster and more cost-efficient system for the University Police Department to detect and locate cars around the campus.
